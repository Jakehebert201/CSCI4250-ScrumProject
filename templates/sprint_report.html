            <h2>Sprint Goal</h2>
            <p>
                The goal of this sprint was to design and implement two foundational features for the Student Tracker
                Application MVP. The first feature focused on enabling students to check in and out of their study sessions
                while validating their location using GPS. The second feature aimed to allow professors to send important
                notifications to all students in real time. These functionalities are central to the app’s core purpose of
                tracking student engagement and improving communication between students and faculty.

            <h2>User Stories Developed in This Sprint</h2>
            <article class="report-card">
                <h3>User Story 1: Student Check-In/Check-Out System</h3>
                <p>
                    As a student, I want to check in and out of the tracker app so I can properly log my study hours. To
                    achieve this, the development team created a responsive interface that allows students to easily start
                    and end their study sessions. The backend was connected to a database that records each session’s start
                    time, end time, and total duration. Location verification was integrated through GPS functionality to
                    ensure that students remain within their designated study area during the session.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During development, the main challenge was maintaining accurate GPS tracking across different mobile
                    devices. The team initially encountered issues with inconsistent location readings, which affected the
                    app’s ability to verify student presence. To resolve this, the developers implemented a geofencing
                    system that detects whether the student remains within a certain radius of their study area. Testing
                    confirmed that this approach improved both performance and reliability. Another challenge involved
                    syncing data between mobile and desktop versions of the app. This was addressed by optimizing the
                    database schema and improving backend API efficiency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By the end of the sprint, the student check-in and check-out feature was functional and stable. Students
                    can now start and stop sessions with reliable time and location logging. The feature met all acceptance
                    criteria, though further optimization for battery consumption and GPS precision is planned for future
                    sprints.

            <article class="report-card">
                <h3>User Story 2: Professor Notification System</h3>
                <p>
                    As a professor, I want to send notifications to all students so that I can quickly share important updates.
                    The team implemented a messaging system that allows professors to create, preview, and send notifications
                    through a simple user interface. Each notification includes a title, message body, and timestamp. Once
                    sent, the notification instantly appears for all logged-in students and is stored in the database for
                    students who log in later. Students can mark notifications as “read,” which updates their dashboard accordingly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The biggest technical challenge for this feature was ensuring that notifications were delivered instantly
                    and reliably across all platforms. The team overcame this by implementing a push notification system using
                    Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), which supports both mobile and web clients. This solution ensured that
                    messages appear in real time without requiring users to refresh their screens. Another challenge involved
                    message formatting and display consistency across devices. The UI was tested extensively to ensure that
                    notifications were clearly visible and easy to read on both desktop and mobile platforms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The final implementation was well received during the sprint review. Professors could broadcast announcements
                    effortlessly, and students received alerts with minimal delay. This feature greatly improves communication
                    between faculty and students, aligning perfectly with the application’s overall goals.

            <h2>Sprint Duration and Workload</h2>
            <p>
                The sprint lasted for two weeks, with each of the four team members contributing an average of six hours per
                week. This resulted in a total of 48 man-hours allocated to this sprint. The workload was evenly distributed
                among team members, ensuring consistent progress throughout the development cycle.

            <h2>Challenges Faced and Lessons Learned</h2>
            <p>
                One major challenge was managing cross-platform synchronization between desktop and mobile environments. The
                team learned that designing modular APIs with clear endpoints simplifies integration and reduces errors. Another
                challenge was coordinating tasks between frontend and backend developers. Daily stand-up meetings helped identify
                blockers early, and maintaining frequent communication through GitHub and Slack improved collaboration.
            </p>
            <p>
                The team also learned the importance of early testing. By conducting incremental tests after each milestone,
                they were able to detect issues before they accumulated. This approach will continue in future sprints to maintain
                quality and efficiency.

            <h2>Sprint Review</h2>
            <p>
                The sprint goal was achieved successfully. The student check-in/check-out feature met its acceptance criteria,
                and the professor notification system was completed and tested with positive feedback. The Product Owner expressed
                satisfaction with the progress, particularly with the stability of the login and GPS tracking features. The team
                agreed to refine the GPS accuracy and begin working on the next set of user stories, which include bug reporting
                and admin account management.

            <h2>Sprint Retrospective</h2>
            <p>
                The team identified several areas for improvement. First, more time should be allocated for integration testing to
                ensure that new features work smoothly with existing components. Second, the team decided to hold shorter, daily
                stand-up meetings rather than longer weekly ones to improve communication and task tracking. Finally, the developers
                agreed to maintain clearer documentation on GitHub to help streamline collaboration and onboarding for future contributors.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, the sprint was productive and demonstrated steady progress toward the Student Tracker Application MVP.
                The team is confident that the next sprint will build upon these results and deliver additional value to end users.
